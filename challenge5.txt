Lab 5 challenge 3 - writeable file system
-----------------------------------------
Assumptions
* While creating new file/dir searching for a dirent with "" file name.
* It is assumed that the blocks to files are assumed in the order of array.
  it means if one of the f_direct is not assigned, that's the end of the file.
* If offset > MAXFILESIZE it apends at the end


Clarify:
* While marking page dirty, how to copy the old permissions?
* sys_page_map while checking for the permissions throws error for PTE_D
* Marking page dirty, enough? or do we need to flush it?
